1. Comprehensive Deployment Strategy Document

Components Covered:

- Spring Boot Application (Containerized)
- MySQL Database with Persistent Storage
- Kubernetes for Orchestration
- Docker Hub for Image Repository
- Jenkins for CI/CD Pipeline
- Ingress for External Access
- Autoscaling and Resource Management

Deployment Steps:

- Source Code Management:
  - Host application code on GitHub
  - Dockerfile, Kubernetes YAMLs, and Helm charts included in the repository

- CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkins Example):
  - Build Stage: Compile Spring Boot application and run tests
  - Docker Stage: Build image, tag with version, push to Docker Hub
  - Deploy Stage: Use kubectl to apply Kubernetes manifests
  - Post-Deploy: Trigger tests or smoke checks

- Kubernetes Deployment:
  - Deploy MySQL with Persistent Volume
  - Deploy Spring Boot application with resource limits, autoscaling, and probes
  - Expose Spring Boot via LoadBalancer or Ingress
  - Autoscaler adjusts pod count based on CPU usage

- Versioning:
  - Images tagged as v1.0, v1.1, etc.
  - Latest stable image tagged as latest

2. Monitoring and Logging Setup

Monitoring Tools:

- Prometheus for collecting metrics (CPU, Memory, Pod Health)
- Grafana for real-time visual dashboards
- Kubernetes Metrics Server required for autoscaling

Logging Setup:

- Application logs streamed to stdout and stderr
- ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized log aggregation
- Kubernetes cluster logs managed using Fluentd or Fluent Bit

Health Checks:

- livenessProbe and readinessProbe in Kubernetes ensure pod health

3. Backup and Disaster Recovery Procedures

Database Backup:

- Schedule automated backups using mysqldump to Persistent Volume or external storage
- Store backups securely in cloud storage such as AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage

Application Recovery:

- Docker images stored on Docker Hub for fast redeployment
- Kubernetes manifests stored in Git for version-controlled redeployment

Cluster Recovery:

- Backup etcd for Kubernetes cluster state
- Use managed Kubernetes services like EKS, AKS, or GKE for built-in resilience

4. Security Best Practices for the Entire Pipeline

- Use Kubernetes Secrets for sensitive data such as database passwords
- No hardcoded credentials in code or images
- Run containers as non-root users
- Apply Network Policies to restrict pod-to-pod communication
- Perform regular image vulnerability scans using tools like Trivy or Docker Hub scanning
- Enable Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Kubernetes
- Secure Jenkins with credentials vaults such as HashiCorp Vault
- Use HTTPS for all external communication with Ingress and TLS
- Keep dependencies and base images updated

5. Troubleshooting Procedures for Common Issues

Common Issues and Fixes:

- Pod CrashLoopBackOff  
  Check logs using kubectl logs and validate environment variables  

- Container will not start  
  Review livenessProbe and readinessProbe configurations  

- Database Connection Errors  
  Validate Secret values and service names inside the cluster  

- Image Pull Errors  
  Ensure image exists in Docker Hub and verify authentication  

- High Resource Usage  
  Adjust resource limits or autoscaling thresholds  

- Ingress Not Accessible  
  Verify Ingress Controller setup and DNS configuration  

- Jenkins Build Failures  
  Review Jenkins console output and check Docker daemon status  

Common Debugging Commands:

kubectl get pods  
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>  
kubectl logs <pod-name>  
kubectl get events  
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/sh
